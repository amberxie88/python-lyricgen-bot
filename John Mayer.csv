0,A Face To Call Home,https://genius.com/John-mayer-a-face-to-call-home-lyrics,"I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been
You know my paper heart
The one I filled with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home
So glad you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small
And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home, a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home
Home home
Home home
Home home
Home home"
1,Born and Raised,https://genius.com/John-mayer-born-and-raised-lyrics,"Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely
I still have dreams, they’re not the same
They don’t fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, “You don’t remember me do you?”
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely
Still got time, still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
Got a mom, got a dad
But they do not have each other
So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
All comes up without warning"
2,If I Ever Get Around To Living,https://genius.com/John-mayer-if-i-ever-get-around-to-living-lyrics,"If I ever get around to living
I'm going to put my things away
In the drawers and in the closets
And there I'll stay
Stay
If I ever get around to living
It's going to be just like I dreamed
I'm going to take the love I'm given
And set it free
Free
If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away
Free
Free
Maybe it's all a dream I'm having at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying, ""Come upstairs, you've got some work to do""
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
You are hiding in your mind
Working all the time
Trying to make it better than you got it
And you been spending all your time
Searching for a sign
That's never going to look the way you want it
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?"
3,Love is a Verb,https://genius.com/John-mayer-love-is-a-verb-lyrics,"Love is a Verb
It ain't a thing
It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a crutch
It's not an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOU's
Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb"
4,Queen of California,https://genius.com/John-mayer-queen-of-california-lyrics,"Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame
I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down
Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down
If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote ""Blue"" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down"
5,Shadow Days,https://genius.com/John-mayer-shadow-days-lyrics,"Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you’re right?
Some people been known to do it
All their lives
But you find yourself alone
Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
Well I'm no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn’t mean I didn’t make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest 
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now"
6,Something Like Olivia,https://genius.com/John-mayer-something-like-olivia-lyrics,"Well, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
I'm thinking something like Olivia
Could keep me through the night
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say, I'd let her in
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
I keep thinking something like Olivia
Is what I need to find
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
I keep thinking something like Olivia"
7,Speak for Me,https://genius.com/John-mayer-speak-for-me-lyrics,"Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Isn't supposed to make me feel alone
What a drag to know
I have to learn to let it go
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Well they’re celebrating broken things
I don’t want a world of broken things
You can tell something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white
What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone"
8,The Age of Worry,https://genius.com/John-mayer-the-age-of-worry-lyrics,"Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
Close your eyes and clone yourself
Build your heart an army
To defend your innocence
While doing everything wrong
Don't be scared to walk alone
Don't be scared to like it
There's no time that you must be home
So sleep where darkness falls
Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, why should I care?""
Ooh! Ooh!
No, your fight is not with them
Yours is with your time here
Dream your dreams, but don't pretend
Make friends with what you are
Give your heart and change your mind
You're allowed to do it
Because God knows it's been done to you and
Somehow you got through it
Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, why should I care?""
Rage in the age of worry
Act your age in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, get out of here"""
9,"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey",https://genius.com/John-mayer-whiskey-whiskey-whiskey-lyrics,"We pick up in New York City
I'm tryna find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed
The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go
Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place
Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
""Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet""
Great, now it's raining
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street"
