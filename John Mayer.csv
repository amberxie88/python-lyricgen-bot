0,Belief,https://genius.com/John-mayer-belief-lyrics,"Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank, at all
For something someone yelled real loud, one time?
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrendered with their life on the line?
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can"
1,Bold as Love,https://genius.com/John-mayer-bold-as-love-lyrics,"Anger, he smiles
Towering in shiny, metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis
My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow, in this case, is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
I'm bold, bold as love
Yeah I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Just ask the axis
Yeah he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows everything
I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking to you
I'm bold, bold as love, yeah"
2,Dreaming With a Broken Heart,https://genius.com/John-mayer-dreaming-with-a-broken-heart-lyrics,"When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my, roses in my hands?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won’t
‘Cause you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part"
3,Gravity,https://genius.com/John-mayer-gravity-lyrics,"Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now, how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is"
4,In Repair,https://genius.com/John-mayer-in-repair-lyrics,"Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
And now I'm walking in a park
All of the birds they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
I'm never really ready
Oh I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there"
5,Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,https://genius.com/John-mayer-slow-dancing-in-a-burning-room-lyrics,"It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's going to come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?"
6,Stop This Train,https://genius.com/John-mayer-stop-this-train-lyrics,"No, I'm not color blind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But, I just can't sleep on this tonight
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?
Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
Said, ""Help me understand""
He said, ""Turn 68, you'll renegotiate""
""Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train""
Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark
Singing, ""Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause, now, I see, I'll never stop this train"""
7,The Heart of Life,https://genius.com/John-mayer-the-heart-of-life-lyrics,"I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's good"
8,Vultures,https://genius.com/John-mayer-vultures-lyrics,"Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from goin' under?
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do 'bout it?
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't you give up
Don't give up, give up, give up"
9,Waiting on the World to Change,https://genius.com/John-mayer-waiting-on-the-world-to-change-lyrics,"One, two. One, two, three
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
And we're still waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
Now we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change"
