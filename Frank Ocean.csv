0,Be Yourself,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-be-yourself-lyrics,"Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana
Because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye"
1,Close to You,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-close-to-you-lyrics,"I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don’t have much longer baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
Just like me, they long to be close to you"
2,Facebook Story,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-facebook-story-lyrics,"I was just telling that I got this girl before
And I was together since 3 years
And uhh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her
And she told me like ""Accept me on Facebook""
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say ""I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook""
She started to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, ""It's over, I can't believe you""
I said ""come on, you're crazy, because like, yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day here in your house""
That's, it means like it's jealousy
Pure jealousy for nothing
You know, virtual thing"
3,Futura Free,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-futura-free-lyrics,"Alright, hold on
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day
And not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my Momma like, ""Momma
I ain't making minimum wage, Momma
I'm on, Momma, I'm on
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800K, Momma
To stand on my feet, Momma
Play these songs, it's therapy, Momma
They paying me, Momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying, y'all honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me, Momma
Let me run this bitch
I'ma run it into the ground, Momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas
Fuck me if I hated on you
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga, you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow
Tech company
Please gimme immortality
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
Smoke some'n
They tryna find 2Pac, don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press, he escape the stress
La da da da da, la da da da da
La da da da da 
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena, they wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door
I only got one four door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so, I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets
Now shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now, not fetch
I ain't runnin' for a nigga, ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
—know and —know, —know and —know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went 180 on me, please run that back though
You say some shit about me?
Turn a real sport, my nigga
That second time Jerron was there, nigga
On God he grabbed me and then that nigga tried to pull me
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga, I had this nigga like—
Make sure you speak up
Okay
What's your name?
Ryan
Yo, ayy be quiet. What's your name? What do you do? What's your first memory?
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?
Friendship and how it controls the world, hahaha
Hahaha, alright, um, what three superpowers do you wish you had? They say they have to be...
Flying, super strength...
Alright, what's your name?
Maybe we can get a little—a little bit, a little bit, a little bit
I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
But forever at the same time
Yo, what, what's, what's the... dog, stop, stop, stop
And ships could fly. Buildings would be very, very tall
And everybody won't know the ground is up
Chloe, shh, okay, start over right now
Best thing about being me is I got a nice set of friends
Pretty clear mind, I feel like, sometimes
Probably, uh, being great
I think a lot, a lot, too much. Sometimes I'm very messy
Talents, got any secret talents?
I don't think so, I'm pretty open and all in everything that I do
Talents? Um, I can play the theremin
Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome
No, actually, no, fuck him. Um, I don't know
Probably Dill 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all
Just sits inside his house
What's your name?
Sage Elsesser
What do you do?
I play soccer and I go to school
Um, I wanna be better at skating
(It's probably up something really high, it's super high
I tried to land, like, a handstand or something)
Alright, that's it...
I spend a couple hours with my family and I go out
And do everything that I ever thought about trying
How far is a light year? How far is a light year?"
4,Godspeed,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-godspeed-lyrics,"I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
Ball so hard, all my boys flex
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still I'll always be there for you how I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes 
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes 
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind 
Ohh, it's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh"
5,Good Guy,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-good-guy-lyrics,"Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
First time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out
This nigga—all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah—I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit... Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how I feel about bi—"
6,Ivy,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-ivy-lyrics,"I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreaming"
7,Nights,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-nights-lyrics,"Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade 
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, 
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body
New beginnin's, ahh
New beginnin's, wake up akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every night shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit"
8,Nikes,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-nikes-lyrics,"These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
一人の男
たくさんかわいい女の子
誰かのことを 誰も縛れはしない
他人の心
まあ、飲みたいならお酒でも飲もう（ふぉ）
彼女がいたり、彼氏がいたり
気の合っちゃう人間２人
しょうがない
男たちと 女たち
去るもの追わず
来るもの選ぶ
それだけの話
今しかない時間
大事にしな
何億万人も
いい人ならいるよ
あの子がまたモデルの子に嫉妬
でも好きなら好き
無理なら無理だし
次から次に （次に）
類が友を呼んでくれるいつも （類が友を呼ぶ）
たまには離れてみるのも必要 （必要…必要…）
自由にする まるでパリスヒルトン "
9,Pink + White,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-pink-white-lyrics,"Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me 
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs 
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality"
10,Pretty Sweet,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-pretty-sweet-lyrics,"Now, to the edge I'll race
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need
What it means to be alive on this side
On this side
On this side
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside, I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life
Mothers of us be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucka
Pretty sweet, pretty sweet"
11,Seigfried,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-seigfried-lyrics,"The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave 
I'm not brave
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell 
What would you recommend I do?
This, this fe-, this feel
This feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel, this feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell 
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon 
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
I'd do anything for you, anything for"
12,Self Control,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-self-control-lyrics,"Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing*
Keep a place for me
It's no thing, it's nothing
It's no thing, it's nothing
Sometimes you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights you're dancing
With tears in your eyes
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it"
13,Skyline To,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-skyline-to-lyrics,"This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older 
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy 
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you come when I call again?
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim 
In comes the morning 
In comes the morning "
14,Solo,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-solo-lyrics,"Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo , solo 
S-solo , s-solo, 
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo
By myself
Solo, solo, solo, solo"
15,Solo (Reprise),https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-solo-reprise-lyrics,"Ayy, ayy, so now I'm—
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I ""geronimo!,"" I just go ""heh""
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, and
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
I pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After 20 years in, I'm so naïve I was under the impression
That everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word
Was I working just way too hard?"
16,White Ferrari,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-white-ferrari-lyrics,"Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life , in this life 
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam"
